                        I would be a great fit for the Customer Success Specialist role because I am a hardworking, patient problem-solver! I have taught English 
                        remotely for the past two years, have over 10 years’ experience in high-end hospitality, and have currently completed half of freeCodeCamp.org’s 
                        coding curriculum in my free time (and I’m still working through it!), and I would love to use my experience to provide your clients with 
                        empathetic, effective support.

                        I'm passionate about supporting charities and nonprofits— that’s the reason why I chose self-study through freeCodeCamp.org instead of paying 
                        other for-profit entities to learn how to code. It’s also the reason why I choose to bank with Aspiration Bank instead of one of the bigger 
                        national banks— they are committed to donating 10% of their earnings to charity, and I want to support companies that do the right thing. 
                        Additionally, I taught beginning English to refugees in Denver, Colorado before moving to Asia, and I frequently gave free lessons to locals in 
                        Thailand and Vietnam during my time there.

                    Two things I am excited to learn are how to run a training session with a customer to set up their campaign and how to update the developer 
                    docs to cover a new release. I love seeing the excitement and ‘click’ of understanding on someone’s face once they feel confident with new information, 
                    so I would love to use my experience in education to teach new users about all the features of the site. I’d also enjoy talking with developers to 
                    understand what changes are being made to different areas and why, and then relaying that information to the customers with new docs.

                    Two things I am not excited about doing are creating content for social media and marketing and coordinating blog posts for the blog. Social media 
                    work and marketing are simply not my strong suits, and I know there are other people who are skilled in those areas. I would much rather take a 
                    problem-solving role where I can interact directly with the customers.

                    The two things I’m most excited to do are to work with developers to debug and resolve a product issue and to plan new product features based on customer 
                    feedback. There is little more I enjoy than solving problems and finding ways to make things better, and these two tasks do exactly that! Throughout my 
                    career, I have always been the ‘fixer’ who makes things happen, and I love thinking of new ways to solve problems or make life easier.

                        My bank, Aspiration Bank, handles customer support issues exceedingly well. Their representatives are friendly, well-trained, empathic people 
                        who don’t read off scripts, and the representatives I have spoken with all seemed to genuinely care about solving the underlying problem. They 
                        seem to genuinely care about the quality of their work-- they're not just in it for a paycheck.
